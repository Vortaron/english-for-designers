# Hi! My name is Michael.

![me as Michal Plecháč](https://github.com/Vortaron/english-for-designers/assets/48156360/dcb76d14-8f48-4ecf-95a1-9ecf265e7434)

# About me as a person

Hi, I am Michael, and I consider myself a **very passionate person**. I really enjoy understanding and **thinking about our universe**. In that vein, I particularly like the theme of **space and sci-fi** because they often come with really interesting ideas. That's why I also enjoy **pop culture**, games, movies, music, books, and artistic human creations in general. **I appreciate what people have to say in their work**. I have also recently become **interested in psychology** and how the brain and people work. I can get **very obsessive** about things I am currently focusing on, and I can get very anxious from time to time. But I feel **that makes me more human** and defines who I am.

## What I enjoy doing:
- **Drawing** (traditional or digital)
- **Playing video games** (mostly with my girlfriend)
- **Exercising** (mostly cardio)
- **Playing music** (guitar and piano)
- **Watching movies and TV shows**
- **Discovering new music**
- **Learning about history and mythology**
- **Exploring different cultures**
- **Reading** (mostly sci-fi genre)

# What I do as job

At the moment, I'm primarily working as a freelancer. Previously, I spent a year creating social media posts for three different companies within a marketing agency. However, I decided to leave there for school and have recently resumed my search for potential jobs. Due to still being a student, I have mainly found part-time positions in different fields.

As a designer, my focus is not explicitly on one thing, but I particularly enjoy inventing and designing. I utilize my skills in various areas to shape my vision, including creating typography, retouching and working with photography, taking photos, drawing illustrations, or shooting. Therefore, I am not afraid to apply these skills when needed. Lately, I've been trying to learn to recognize my limits and understand when I'm beyond what I am capable and willing to do, recognizing when I need someone else to contribute to the project.

## What I usually do:

- Create visual identities
- Design posters for promotional materials
- Craft posts for social media
- Develop packaging for products
- Design simple logos
- Create business cards
- Film and photograph
- Design social media graphics
- Create website designs
- Animate
- Draw storyboards

## My PASSION projetct: Pilots 303 (the gane)

This project was created as an educational game for English language school with the aim of introduce children to Czech and Polish pilots in the Battle of Britain in 1940. The game offers an attractive form of education that introduces the importance of the Czech and Polish RAF pilots and allows players to experience the important historical events.

### Historical Accuracy vs. Fun

* visualizing the idea of recruiting players
* creating 2 posters for 2 showings

## Abstract world of Music festival Kutná Hora

The International Music Festival Kutná Hora is one of the most important chamber music events in the Czech Republic. The aim was to create a modern visual identity that correctly represents the events of this festival and reach out to new visitors. My visual solution was to connect the atmosphere of the concert with an abstract form of light and sound, conveying the feeling of chamber classical music and gothic buildings in Kutná Hora.

### Creating the Feeling

* finding cool fonts fot my idea
* creating system
* presenting for imporant people

## Animating, because it sounded cool

The aim of the exercise was to create a short animation as an invitation to a school Fest Michael festival. I created the animation in the form of a fairy tale about the creation of the festival, presented in the style of a digital puppet theatre. After creating the storyboards, I drew and animated the objects. The resulting animation was then screened at the Lucerna Cinema.

* wanted create something really cool!
* how the hell animation works
* make it easy (for me)
* spending whole christmas drawing

## Drawing and Painting (mostly in digital)

I started with drawing. Before diving into all this art stuff, I wanted to be a programmer. However, when I attended a programming school, I realized it wasn't really for me. During that time, I also discovered drawing through friends who were passionate about it. So, I became very interested, started drawing, and eventually decided to change my field to art, which then evolved into graphic design.

### Pieces I consider Finished

* I like to train, but I am not doing it tho
* people, te hardest, but the most fun
* grayscale is my friend

## Photography of food & stuff..

As a kid in elementary school, I attended a photography course, and I absolutely loved itttt. It was awesome, and with a friend of mine, we began dreaming about buying our own cameras. So, we did. We started taking pictures together, mostly of nature and architecture. Eventually, we moved on from it, but it stuck with me, and I found a way to integrate it into my graphic design work.

# One Word Essay Videogames // final draft

## Introduction: The Role of Videogames in My Life
The term "videogames" encompasses more than just a pastime for me—it signifies a profound influence on my formative years. From shared experiences with friends on vintage consoles to solo adventures that captivated my imagination, videogames have been pivotal in shaping my social connections and creative aspirations.

## Navigating Childhood with Games
My early years were marked by a blend of physical play and digital exploration, with video games being a constant companion. They helped me maintain friendships despite the challenges of distance and the transient nature of school relationships. Through various game genres, I found solace, creativity, and competition, each leaving an indelible mark on my character.

## Videogames as a Catalyst for Growth and Ambition
The impact of video games extended beyond leisure, guiding my educational and career goals. They inspired academic projects and personal endeavors, such as my commitment to advancing the Czechoslovak esports league. Gaming is not just a hobby; it's a narrative that has influenced every chapter of my life story.

## Future Goals: Shaping the Gaming World
As I continue to immerse myself in the world of gaming, my aspirations have only become more focused. I aim to contribute to the gaming industry, not just as a participant, but as a creator and innovator, driven by the same passion that began in childhood.
