# About me as a person

Hi, I am Michael, and I consider myself a **very passionate person**. I really enjoy understanding and **thinking about our universe**. In that vein, I particularly like the theme of **space and sci-fi** because they often come with really interesting ideas. That's why I also enjoy **pop culture**, games, movies, music, books, and artistic human creations in general. **I appreciate what people have to say in their work**. I have also recently become **interested in psychology** and how the brain and people work. I can get **very obsessive** about things I am currently focusing on, and I can get very anxious from time to time. But I feel **that makes me more human** and defines who I am.

## What I enjoy doing:
- **Drawing** (traditional or digital)
- **Playing video games** (mostly with my girlfriend)
- **Exercising** (mostly cardio)
- **Playing music** (guitar and piano)
- **Watching movies and TV shows**

# What I do as job

At the moment, I'm primarily working as a freelancer. Previously, I spent a year creating social media posts for three different companies within a marketing agency. However, I decided to leave there for school and have recently resumed my search for potential jobs. Due to still being a student, I have mainly found part-time positions in different fields.

As a designer, my focus is not explicitly on one thing, but I particularly enjoy inventing and designing. I utilize my skills in various areas to shape my vision, including creating typography, retouching and working with photography, taking photos, drawing illustrations, or shooting. Therefore, I am not afraid to apply these skills when needed. Lately, I've been trying to learn to recognize my limits and understand when I'm beyond what I am capable and willing to do, recognizing when I need someone else to contribute to the project.

## What I usually do:

- Create visual identities
- Design posters for promotional materials
- Craft posts for social media
- Develop packaging for products
- Design simple logos
- Create business cards
- Film and photograph
- Design social media graphics
- Create website designs
- Animate
- Draw storyboards

# My Projects

## My Passion Project: Pilots 303

This project was created as an educational game for English language school with the aim of introduce children to Czech and Polish pilots in the Battle of Britain in 1940. The game offers an attractive form of education that introduces the importance of the Czech and Polish RAF pilots and allows players to experience the important historical events.

### Choosing a Game

![slide-game-project-1](https://github.com/Vortaron/english-for-designers/assets/48156360/3f1b7a1a-2652-4d50-9b83-7d9f9f5b6fbd)

Originaly I wanted to create another game, focusing more on psychology and creating a game set inside the mind of someone. However, I did not find a story idea that I was satisfied with. Then, a school in London contacted our school expressing interest in having a tool to teach their children about Czech and Polish involvement in the Battle of Britain during World War II. I thought a game would be an excellent way to convey this information, so I decided to delve into the world of pilots and World War II and give it a try.

### Creating World of War 

![slide-game-project-2](https://github.com/Vortaron/english-for-designers/assets/48156360/9aad11b2-8085-496c-bdbe-8388987c9707)

I created the story for the game, which took me almost three months and was the most challenging part. Then, based on real-life locations, I developed the environment and characters. I designed the logo, UI, and in-game graphics. Additionally, I outlined the gameplay for each section during that time.
Throughout the development process, I struggled with visualizing real-life pilots due to the lack of photography from that era. So, I had the idea of using artificial intelligence to learn their faces and replicate their likenesses, and it worked! Now, I have full HD pictures of them, serving as both a reference and usable assets.

### Recruiting the Soldiers

![slide-game-project-3](https://github.com/Vortaron/english-for-designers/assets/48156360/b3b15e10-d5fa-41c3-8882-9a5bf289467e)

When I finished the game itself, I wanted to create some promotional materials for it. I had this cool idea of designing posters and social media content as recruitment propaganda to join the game's RAF squad. Because the main heroes of my story were used in propaganda due to their success, it would be historically correct. Moreover, it would invite players to engage with my game in a fun meta way.

## Abstract World of Music festival Kutná Hora

The International Music Festival Kutná Hora is one of the most important chamber music events in the Czech Republic. The aim was to create a modern visual identity that correctly represents the events of this festival and reach out to new visitors. My visual solution was to connect the atmosphere of the concert with an abstract form of light and sound, conveying the feeling of chamber classical music and gothic buildings in Kutná Hora.

### Creating the Feeling

![hora-1](https://github.com/Vortaron/english-for-designers/assets/48156360/bb77cc63-ffc6-469f-9e89-a5d5cc93a052)

When the International Music Festival Kutná Hora contacted us to create a new brand identity for them, I was drawn to their unique theme of playing classical music in gothic-themed structures. Instead of describing the concert itself, I wanted to capture the essence and feeling of the event. Despite facing difficulties and moments where I considered giving up, I eventually came up with an abstract yet practical idea. I decided to play with the interplay of light and the shapes of gothic windows to convey the atmosphere of the concert.

### Putting Feeling on Paper and Screen

![hora-2](https://github.com/Vortaron/english-for-designers/assets/48156360/ca2a035a-45f0-40cc-8c67-6f1c79afe2e9)

Then, I added a gothic-themed typography and devised a system for utilizing this style of graphics for the upcoming years of the festival. I also outlined how to implement this system on the website and in photos and graphics for social media. Unfortunately, they didn't choose my design, but I am still very happy with it.

## Animation for School Festival

The aim of the exercise was to create a short animation as an invitation to a school Fest Michael festival. I created the animation in the form of a fairy tale about the creation of the festival, presented in the style of a digital puppet theatre. After creating the storyboards, I drew and animated the objects. The resulting animation was then screened at the Lucerna Cinema.

### Origins of my animation

![storyboard](https://github.com/Vortaron/english-for-designers/assets/48156360/87a7262c-98b4-4c92-ade5-cc11b867c79a)

We were assigned the task of creating an animation for an upcoming school festival, where the school showcases its students' works. Eager to produce something unique, I came up with two ideas. The first involved a propaganda video criticizing another festival, but it was denied. Instead, I opted for the second idea: a simple fairytale-like story presented as a puppet show, depicting the creation of our school festival. Although challenging and time-consuming—I spent the entire Christmas holiday drawing assets—it was rewarding to see my work projected in the cinema. I am very proud of the final result.

## Drawing and Painting (mostly in digital)

I started with drawing. Before diving into all this art stuff, I wanted to be a programmer. However, when I attended a programming school, I realized it wasn't really for me. During that time, I also discovered drawing through friends who were passionate about it. So, I became very interested, started drawing, and eventually decided to change my field to art, which then evolved into graphic design.

### Finished Artworks and Studies

![artwork-1](https://github.com/Vortaron/english-for-designers/assets/48156360/b736cafe-7131-4167-8b06-8b69e6e4799e)

I like making fan art of things I really enjoy. I always try to challenge myself to get better at drawing. I focus more on my own style than making things look super realistic because it makes me happier. Sometimes, though, I feel my drawings aren't as good as I want them to be, so I keep working hard to get better.

### Not Finished Artworks and Studies

![artwork-2](https://github.com/Vortaron/english-for-designers/assets/48156360/988ce7fd-7fb6-4dc0-8d6a-fcdb892d537e)

I enjoy exercising, but I don't do it as much as I want. Drawing people is tricky, but it's also a lot of fun for me. When I'm creating, I like using shades of gray because it helps me bring out different details in my work.

## Product photography

As a kid in elementary school, I attended a photography course, and I absolutely loved itttt. It was awesome, and with a friend of mine, we began dreaming about buying our own cameras. So, we did. We started taking pictures together, mostly of nature and architecture. Eventually, we moved on from it, but it stuck with me, and I found a way to integrate it into my graphic design work.

Marlenka asked me to take pictures of their delicious cakes and sweet treats, so I said yes. It felt like making my childhood dreams come true because I always loved taking photos. I got to be in charge, like a director, deciding how to make the cakes look their best in photos. It was a lot of fun, even though it made me a bit tired.
