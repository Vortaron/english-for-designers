# Oh, hi Mark
### Profesional side of me

Hi! I am a passionate graphic designer and creative who is always thinking of new ideas and challenges. My interests include art, culture, games, music and deep science concepts, especially science fiction. My dream is to one day bring something unique and innovative to the design world.

### Me as a person with feelings & stuff

Hi again, I am a weird person, but I consider it a good thing. I like to think about stuff, I really like space and sci-fi - I just really like cool ideas, even if they are not portrait that well. I really like popculture, games and artitic human creations. I became interested in psychology and how brain and people work. I am very axnious person and I like ordet in things and I am nervous when there is none (at least for some period time). I am consider myself very passionate about anything I am interested and I am enyoing learning about stuff. I get vey obscessive about 1 think I often forget about other things. But sometimes too much thinking is unhealthy and exxhausting, so nowdays I am trying to learn to also stay in the moment and enjoy life. Btw I also like to read (mostly sci-fi tho).

## My PASSION projetct: Pilots 303 (the gane)

This project was created as an educational game for English language school with the aim of introduce children to Czech and Polish pilots in the Battle of Britain in 1940. The game offers an attractive form of education that introduces the importance of the Czech and Polish RAF pilots and allows players to experience the important historical events.

### Historical Accuracy vs. Fun

## Abstract world of Music festival Kutná Hora

The International Music Festival Kutná Hora is one of the most important chamber music events in the Czech Republic. The aim was to create a modern visual identity that correctly represents the events of this festival and reach out to new visitors. My visual solution was to connect the atmosphere of the concert with an abstract form of light and sound, conveying the feeling of chamber classical music and gothic buildings in Kutná Hora.

### Creating the Feeling

* finding cool fonts fot my idea
* creating system
* presenting for imporant people

## Animating, because it sounded cool

The aim of the exercise was to create a short animation as an invitation to a school Fest Michael festival. I created the animation in the form of a fairy tale about the creation of the festival, presented in the style of a digital puppet theatre. After creating the storyboards, I drew and animated the objects. The resulting animation was then screened at the Lucerna Cinema.

* wanted create something really cool!
* how the hell animation works
* make it easy (for me)
* spending whole christmas drawing

## Drawing and Painting (mostly in digital)

I started with drawing. Before diving into all this art stuff, I wanted to be a programmer. However, when I attended a programming school, I realized it wasn't really for me. During that time, I also discovered drawing through friends who were passionate about it. So, I became very interested, started drawing, and eventually decided to change my field to art, which then evolved into graphic design.

### Pieces I consider Finished

* I like to train, but I am not doing it tho
* people, te hardest, but the most fun
* grayscale is my friend

## Photography of food & stuff..

As a kid in elementary school, I attended a photography course, and I absolutely loved itttt. It was awesome, and with a friend of mine, we began dreaming about buying our own cameras. So, we did. We started taking pictures together, mostly of nature and architecture. Eventually, we moved on from it, but it stuck with me, and I found a way to integrate it into my graphic design work.

# One Word Essay Videogames // final draft

## Introduction: The Role of Videogames in My Life
The term "videogames" encompasses more than just a pastime for me—it signifies a profound influence on my formative years. From shared experiences with friends on vintage consoles to solo adventures that captivated my imagination, videogames have been pivotal in shaping my social connections and creative aspirations.

## Navigating Childhood with Games
My early years were marked by a blend of physical play and digital exploration, with video games being a constant companion. They helped me maintain friendships despite the challenges of distance and the transient nature of school relationships. Through various game genres, I found solace, creativity, and competition, each leaving an indelible mark on my character.

## Videogames as a Catalyst for Growth and Ambition
The impact of video games extended beyond leisure, guiding my educational and career goals. They inspired academic projects and personal endeavors, such as my commitment to advancing the Czechoslovak esports league. Gaming is not just a hobby; it's a narrative that has influenced every chapter of my life story.

## Future Goals: Shaping the Gaming World
As I continue to immerse myself in the world of gaming, my aspirations have only become more focused. I aim to contribute to the gaming industry, not just as a participant, but as a creator and innovator, driven by the same passion that began in childhood.
