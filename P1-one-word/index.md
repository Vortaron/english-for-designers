## **Videogames** // final draft

The word I've chosen is "videogames." Even though this word is a general term or an umbrella term, it has had a massive impact on my life. When we talk about video games, I remember the times when I played on my dad's old computer and PlayStation 1 with my friends at home. It truly brought us closer and created unforgettable memories.
Back then, I had my friends with me at our cottage, where my parents and I spent weekends, holidays, and any days we had off. When I was at the cottage, we would often go out and alternate being outside with playing video games. It was great because we both liked it, and we always had something fun to do. But, when I had to go to school during the week, I couldn't be with my friends since I lived an hour and a half drive away. I wanted to make friends at school, but it was hard for me. I switched classes a lot in my first five years of school, so even when I found a friend, we didn't stay friends for long.
Luckily, I grew up in a time when the internet was developed well enough, that it wasn't such a problem. So my friends and I would call on Skype almost every day back then and play games together. We switched games. First, we played Call of Duty, which was hard for me. Then, we spent a long time in Minecraft, which helped me be creative. After that, we started playing League of Legends, which showed me the world of esports. These games had a big effect on me. Even when we got frustrated or had bad days, they made us feel close to each other.
Today, even if my friends don't play these games anymore and think they're a waste of time, I know these games have been important to me. Video games are the reason I do what I do today. They inspired me to start working in the visual and creative field, and they still inspire me to this day. For example, I like League of Legends, and I hope to work on something connected to it. Video games made me write a big paper about making games and tell a story for a history video game.
This year, I'm doing a school project to make the Czechoslovak esports league in League of Legends better. I love video games a lot. They give me so many cool things to do. Like amazing stories in single-player games that I'll never forget. I get to make things in Minecraft, play to win with my friends, and root for my favorite team in my favorite game. I am super happy when they win and sad when they lose.
All these things make me want to work in the gaming world one day. I want to help make it even more awesome because it's given me so much and means a lot to me.
